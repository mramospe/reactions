Contributing to the Reactions package
=====================================

The development of the package is done in the `devel` branch. Pull requests must
be done with this branch as a target for small modifications and to `master` for
sizeable changes to the project.
Changes to the CI should always target `devel`.
For issues, recommendations or discussions please use the repository
[issues](https://github.com/mramospe/reactions/issues) section.
