Installation
============

The recommended way to install the package is through the `pip` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install https://github.com/mramospe/reactions/tarball/master

Note that you can specify the branch/tag to use in the last bit of the URL. If you are planning
to add this package as a dependency to one of your projects, include the previous URL in your
`requirements.txt` file.

Remember that you can also install the package in-place, something useful for developers, by calling

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/mramospe/reactions.git
   pip install -e reactions
